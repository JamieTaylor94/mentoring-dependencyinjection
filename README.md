# Dependency Injection (DI)

Repositories I have labelled "mentoring" are from a time that I was taking on mentoring responsibilities of other developers. I like the idea of providing a lesson situation followed by a practical example. The developer would work through each part and then create a document of their learnings and then we would have a one-to-one session to go over the practical together.

## What is dependency injection?

I've thought about how to best explain DI and after a search online realised, I cannot better explain it that this guy (Nick Hodges). At least read the first two articles - the website may not allow you to read the third, but it is more important you understand what DI is and its benefits.

## Practical 

First, familiarise yourself with the code

Make sure you can answer the following questions:
- What is this application?
- Where is the data coming from?
- How does the data get onto the page?
- What version of dotnet is being used?
- Explain the order of events/walk me through it

There is a class *VehicleServiceTests.cs* that is incomplete that you need to get working. 

Hints:

- Learn how to do DI in dotnet core.
- Modify code to use dependency injection
- Create mocks for dependencies

## Write up

Create a file called dependency-injection.md

Answer the following questions:

What is dependency injection?   
Why do we use dependency injection?   

Insert a link that goes to that file in the repo in your GitHub account.
